## **🛠 Prerequisites**  
Before setting up this project, ensure you have the following installed:  

- **Node.js** (LTS version) → [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/)  
- **npm** (Comes with Node.js)  
- **Git** (Version Control) → [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/)  
- **VS Code** (Recommended Editor) → [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

---

## **📌 Step 1: Clone the Project**  
Use Git to clone the repository and navigate into the project folder:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/revmarket.git
cd revmarket
```
If you don’t have Git installed, **manually download the ZIP file** from GitHub and extract it.

---

## **📌 Step 2: Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install all required packages:  
```sh
npm install
```
This will install React, React Router, Material-UI, and other dependencies.

---

## **📌 Step 3: Start the Development Server**  
To start the project, run:  
```sh
npm start
```
This will launch the app at **http://localhost:3000/** 🚀  

---

## **📌 Step 4: Project Structure**  
Understanding the folder structure will help you navigate the project:  
```
revmarket/
│── public/            # Static assets (e.g., logo, favicon)
│── src/               # Source code  
│   ├── components/    # Reusable UI components (Navbar, CarCard, etc.)
│   ├── pages/         # Pages (Home, Buy, Sell, Dashboard, etc.)
│   ├── App.js         # Main app component  
│   ├── index.js       # React entry point  
│── package.json       # Dependencies & scripts  
│── README.md          # Documentation  
```

---

## **📌 Step 5: Available Pages & Navigation**  
Here are the key pages and routes in the application:

| Page Name   | Route            | Description |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Home** | `/` | Landing page with an overview of vehicles |
| **Buy** | `/buy` | Browse all listed vehicles |
| **Sell** | `/sell` | List a vehicle for sale |
| **Saved Cars (Shortlist)** | `/saved` | View saved vehicles |
| **Dashboard/Profile** | `/dashboard` | User account & settings |
| **Login** | `/login` | User authentication page |
| **Admin Panel** | `/admin` | Manage users & listings (Admin only) |

---

## **📌 Step 6: Role-Based Access**  
- **Normal Users:** Can browse, buy, sell, and save cars.  
- **Admins:** Have access to the Admin Panel to manage listings and users.  

The admin panel is **protected** using the following logic:  
```js
const AdminRoute = ({ element }) => {
  const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
  return user && user.role === "admin" ? element : <Navigate to="/" />;
};
```
If a non-admin tries to access `/admin`, they are redirected to the homepage.

## **📌 Step 7: Styling & UI**  
We use **Material-UI (MUI)** for styling. If you want to customize the theme or components, check out:  
🔹 [Material-UI Docs](https://mui.com/)  

Example of a **styled button** using MUI:  
```js
<Button variant="contained" color="primary">Buy Now</Button>
```

---

## **📌 Step 8: Deployment**  
Once the project is ready for production, you can deploy it using:  
```sh
npm run build
```
This will create a **build** folder, which can be deployed on hosting services like **Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages**.

---

## **📌 Step 9: Troubleshooting**  
If you face errors, try the following:  

1️⃣ **Clear npm cache & reinstall dependencies:**  
```sh
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

2️⃣ **Restart the app:**  
```sh
npm start
```

3️⃣ **Check for console errors in the browser and terminal.**
